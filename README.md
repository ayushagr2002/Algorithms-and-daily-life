# Algorithms-and-daily-life
A book explaining algorithms and applications of algorithms in real life in an interesting and intuitive way

It will introduce the readers about the beautiful world of
algorithms. What are algorithms, why do we need them, how do we
implement them. The book will contain a simplistic approach to algorithms
which will enable a person without any knowledge of the subject to appreciate
and learn algorithms. It will highlight many points which do not seem trivial
and largely go unnoticed among the general learners. It will contain detailed
examples from the real-world where we find extensive uses of algorithms and
how it has become a part of our daily life. It will contain in-depth analysis of
various algorithms taught in class with a special focus on graph algorithms as
there are a lot of real-world problems which can be modelled as graphical
problems. It will also compare various algorithms, consider pros and cons of
each algorithm and try to present an unbiased and correct picture to the
reader. The booklet will help to visualise algorithms using tables, pictures, reallife examples etc. which will enable the reader to enjoy as well as learn
simultaneously.
